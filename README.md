nRF52832 based beacon design

Simple reference design in a 1"x1.2" form factor with CR2032 battery holder.  For maximum battery life, ditch protection 
diode D2 and replace it with a FET (or just a jumper).  Tested to work with examples from the nRF52 SDK v11.0.0, but no
guarantees as to the effectiveness of the antenna.
